  The nfs-client job provides the necessary packages to allow volumes
  to be mounted from other servers via NFS.

templates:
  bin/pre-start:   bin/pre-start
  bin/post-deploy: bin/post-deploy

packages:
  - nfs-debs

properties:
  mounts:
    description: |
      A list of remote volumes to mount.  Each item must have the
      `server` (IP or hostname of the NFS server), `remote` (remote
      volume directory path), and `local` (local mount point) keys.

      By default, mounts will be done in the post-deploy hook.
      You can instead force them earlier, in the pre-start hook,
      by setting the `when` key to the value "immediate".
