description: |
  The nfs-server job provides the necessary package and kernel instrumentation
  to export arbitrary mountpoints over NFS, probably to boxes that are also
  co-locating the nfs-client job.

  exports:
    description: |
      A list of directories to be exported to clients.  This will be used to
      create the /etc/exports file routinely used by NFS servers to control
      access, uid/gid mapping, etc.

      Each entry in the list must have a `path` key (containing the absolute
      path to the export, server-side), and a `clients` key (containing a list of
      hostnames and or network addresses / ranges from which clients can connect).

      Relative `path` values will be interpreted as relative to `/var/vcap/store`.

      Each entry may feature an `options` key: a list of NFS options to be applied
      to the exporrted filesystem.  If no options are listed, the following are
      assumed:

        - `rw`
        - `no_subtree_check`
        - `sync`

      Refer to the `exports(5)` man page for more details.  Note that if you
      do supply `options`, these defaults will not be included unless you
      explicitly add them back in.

      Some options are set regardless of what you put in the manifest, mainly to
      handle BOSH-isms.  All UID/GIDs will be remapped to vcap:vcap (locally),
      via `all_squash` and the appropriate `anonuid=` / `anongid=` settings.
